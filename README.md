# Sales Invoice Generator

A sales invoice is an accounting document that records a business transaction. It provides the business with a record of the services theyâ€™ve provided to a client, when the services were rendered and how much money the client owes the business.

Typically, a sales invoice will include a description of the service provided and the amount owed. Sales invoices are crucial to small-business accounting because they enable you to record transactions of your sales for bookkeeping purposes.

It is a Java-based desktop application "Sales Invoice Generator" to help customers (Businesses) automatically generate and retain the history of transactions the business has.
